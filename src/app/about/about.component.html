                    My name is Suraj Khodade, a <span class="default-highlight">Senior Software Engineer</span> with 6+ years of progressive experience in building scalable, secure, and cloud-native enterprise applications. Based in Pune, India, I’ve worked across domains including <span class="default-highlight">Healthcare</span>, <span class="default-highlight">Insurance</span>, <span class="default-highlight">Travel</span>, <span class="default-highlight">Payroll</span>, and <span class="default-highlight">MLM</span>, delivering software that solves real business problems at scale.

                <p class="default-p">
                    My passion for software development began in 2018 when I had to collect and process large datasets during my final-year engineering projects. This challenge introduced me to programming, automation, and data systems—and eventually inspired me to specialize in full-stack software development. Since then, I’ve committed myself to building robust, performance-oriented solutions using technologies such as <span class="default-highlight">.NET Core</span>, <span class="default-highlight">C#</span>, <span class="default-highlight">Microservices</span>, <span class="default-highlight">Angular</span>, <span class="default-highlight">SQL Server</span>, and <span class="default-highlight">Azure</span>.

                <p class="default-p">
                    I’ve worked at some of the most innovative tech-driven organizations including <span class="default-highlight">Globant</span> and <span class="default-highlight">CitiusTech Healthcare</span>, where I’ve designed microservice-based architectures, optimized CI/CD pipelines using <span class="default-highlight">Azure DevOps</span>, and integrated cloud-native services using <span class="default-highlight">Azure Functions</span>, <span class="default-highlight">Logic Apps</span>, and <span class="default-highlight">Service Bus</span>. My solutions have led to measurable outcomes like reducing deployment time by 30% and API latency by 40%.

                <p class="default-p">
                    My technical toolkit also includes <span class="default-highlight">Docker</span>, <span class="default-highlight">Kubernetes</span> for managing scalable containers and orchestration. I’ve been part of teams that transitioned monoliths into modern <span class="default-highlight">Microservices</span> and asynchronous systems using <span class="default-highlight">RabbitMQ</span>, improving resilience and observability. My exposure to <span class="default-highlight">ETL pipelines</span>, <span class="default-highlight">data integration</span>, and <span class="default-highlight">real-time event processing</span> makes me well-suited for both backend and data-intensive platforms.

                    I hold two Microsoft certifications: <span class="default-highlight">Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)</span> and <span class="default-highlight">Azure Data Fundamentals (DP-900)</span>. These credentials reflect my strong grounding in cloud architecture, data services, and enterprise-grade deployments on Azure.

                    In my professional journey, I’ve played the roles of contributor, lead, and mentor. I’ve led teams of 5+ developers, reviewed codebases for scalability and maintainability, and introduced clean code practices across sprints. I value strong collaboration, empathy, and clear communication—especially when working with cross-cultural clients in <span class="default-highlight">Europe</span>, where I’ve participated in Agile planning, backlog grooming, sprint demos, and delivery retrospectives.
